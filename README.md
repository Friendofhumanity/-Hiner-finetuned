This project is on NER(Named Entity Recognition) is a natural language processing (NLP) method that extracts information from text. NER involves identifying and categorizing important information in text known as named entities. And i have performed this task in a dataset which is in Hindi language taken from a research paper known as HiNER: A Large Hindi Named Entity Recognition Dataset




This repository contains the Hindi Named Entity Recognition dataset (HiNER) published at the Langauge Resources and Evaluation conference (LREC) in 2022. A pre-print via arXiv is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13743).

Recent Updates
Version 0.0.5: HiNER initial release


I have used the above  repository to train my model of NER task and used that model to perform Named Entity Recognition
